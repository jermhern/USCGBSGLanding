## About me üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª
Before I went to bootcamp in 2018, Z-196, I created a website to help me and those going to bootcamp a good resource to look-over. I decided it was time to take one of my passions outside of work, App Development, and help those who are ready to start their Coast Guard Journey. My app will help you become confident with what you'll need to succeed through Cape May
