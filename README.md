<i>First and foremost, as it says on the bottom of this README â€“ this is an UNOFFICIAL app and is NOT AFFILIATED with the United States Coast Guard (USCG) or the United States Government (USG) in any capacity. The USCG and the USG do not approve, endorse, sponsor, co-sign (or any other similar word you can think of) anything thatâ€™s on this application. The same goes for anything thatâ€™s found on the pages of the \"USCG Bootcamp Study Guide\". I, the owner of this application, disclaim any liability for any accidental inclusion of something that is, or might be, in violation of USCG or USG rules and regulations. I have done my best to design this app and its associated content to be within the legal boundaries of the USCG and the USG. If for some reason I have overlooked something and have included something outside the legal parameters of what the USCG and USG allow for unofficial, 3rd party websites (and content) about the USCG, I sincerely apologize. I humbly request that if that is the case, that someone who handles legal matters for the USCG contact me and notify me of the infraction and I will gladly change it so that I am in compliance. If need be, I also have no problem removing anything that is not in compliance.</i>
